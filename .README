#MC Server GUI

##Overview

If you play Minecrtaft and want to avoid paying a ton of money for a third-party service to host your server so you host it on your own VPS like AWS EC2 but you hate managing it through the CLI, just connect it to MC Server GUI to get a user interface to maintain, update, and send commands to your MC Server.
